### Movment Rule Ideas

#### Rochade
* Can only move as if castling (German: "Rochade"):
  * either: `⬜️♙⬜️⬜️♟⬜️ -> ⬜️⬜️♟♙⬜️⬜️`
  * or: `⬜️♙⬜️⬜️⬜️♟⬜️ -> ⬜️⬜️♟♙⬜️⬜️⬜️`
* &rarr; cannot capture pieces

## Passive Rules

#### Corona
* Starts with 1 Virus
* after every turn, the number of viruses doubles
* after 8 viruses, they spread to adjacent cells &rarr; all non-infected pieces get 1 virus
  * after spreading the own virus the piece is immune
  * after spreading the enemy virus the piece dies

#### Puffmutter
* when moving all 8-adjacent pawns move along as well
* pawn's relative position to the Puffmutter remains the same. When a pawn would land on an occupied square then it stops on the preceding square

#### Double Agent

* Can be moved by either player.
* Clarify with the other players the exact definition for "friendly fire", in order to avoid confusion.
* You may want to agree with other rule-makers, that double agents can always be captured by their own color, even by pieces without friendly fire.
* You may want to use a non-standard board setup, e.g. having the starting positions of the double agents closer to the centre of the board.

#### Frozone

* Covers the cells it moves across with ice
* Pieces that would move onto an ice-covered cell instead continue moving until they move onto a not-covered cell or hit a wall or another piece.
* reference to the character from The Incredibles

#### Medusa

* If you try to use a Medusa you must put on a blindfold until your next turn

## Complete Pieces

#### :poop: Not a pawn
* Moves like a pawn. Captures like a pawn. Is a pawn. Very deceptive!

#### Duo

* Piece: ♙
* Movement: 1 or 2 cells vertically (either direction), cannot capture.
* Passive: After every turn on a same color cell one copper gets mined, can store up to 2 copper pieces.
* Invoke: Consume one copper to shoot at another piece. Roll a d6 to decide whether the shot was a success. See diagram below for minimum roll needed for success.
* is a reference to the basic tower in Mindustry

#### Medium (Blutopfer): Inv☑️, FF❌
* Figur: Bauer
* Spielvorbereitung: 1 Schale pro Spieler. Davor stehen die 3 Geister (je 1 Läufer, Springer und Turm)
* Sonderregel: Wenn eine "Geist-Figur" geschlagen wird, wird sie in die Schale ihres Besitzers gelegt.
* Invoke: Medium opfert sich und legt einen Geist in die Schale
* Bewegung: hat Bewegungsoptionen von allen Figuren in seiner Schale
